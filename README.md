This is Python code running in the Ryzen-AI software environment.

Once I got the examples running I created a quantize script and an inference script. 

I got some help from AMD which is documented here: [Issue 92](https://github.com/amd/RyzenAI-SW/issues/92)

This included getting a download that let it run on IPU / CPU.

This repo is an artifact entered into
