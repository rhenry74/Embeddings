This is Python code running in the Ryzen-AI software environment.

Once I got the examples running I created a quantize script and an inference script. I got some help from AMD which is documented here: https://github.com/amd/RyzenAI-SW/issues/92
This included getting a download that let it run on IPU / CPU.
